# deep-learning-final-project

For your final project you should explore any topic you are interested in related to deep learning. This could involve training a model for a new task, building a new dataset, improving deep models in some way and testing on standard benchmarks, etc. You project should probably involve some implementation, some data, and some training. The amount of effort and time should be approximately 2 homework assignments.

- website describing your project
- 2-3 minute video. 
  - problem setup
  - data used 
  - techniques, etc
  - description of which components were from preexisting work (i.e. code from github) and which components were implemented for the project (i.e. new code, gathered dataset, etc).
