# deep-learning-final-project

For your final project you should explore any topic you are interested in related to deep learning. This could involve training a model for a new task, building a new dataset, improving deep models in some way and testing on standard benchmarks, etc. You project should probably involve some implementation, some data, and some training. The amount of effort and time should be approximately 2 homework assignments.

- website describing your project
- 2-3 minute video. 
  - problem setup
  - data used 
  - techniques, etc
  - description of which components were from preexisting work (i.e. code from github) and which components were implemented for the project (i.e. new code, gathered dataset, etc).



## Abstract 
In the health sciences, early and accurate detection of maladies can allow for better quality of life for patients and dramatically affect survival rate. In the recent decade, machine learningâ€™s applications in the health sciences have allowed diseases to be detected with an accuracy never before seen. In this project, we aim to train a model that is able to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI scans.
To this end, we combined multiple datasets containing imaging of MRI scans and trained a neural network using the created dataset. With the dataset, there was a difficult decision to be made because the details of the MRI scan are important for determining whether there is a brain tumor present. However, having very large data points makes model training slow. In order to account for this as well as the small size of the dataset, we perform data augmentation before training

## Problem statement 
In this project, we attempt to create a model which is able to accurately determine, given a MRI scan, whether the scan contains an image of a brain with a brain tumor.
